# Project Plan: 

## Simulation Methods: 
  Position Based Dynamics \
  Neighbor Search using Spatial Hashing\
  Rigid Body Collisions using Signed Distance Fields\
  Two-Way Coupling of Fluids with Clothing and Rigid Bodies 

## minimum target: 
  3D PBF \
  Collision with static convex objects (spheres, cubes...) 
## desired target: 
  Collision with daynamic simple objects and maybe static meshes 
## bonus target: 
  Collision with sand castle or cloth 
  
# Milestones: 

Setting up framework, extension for 3D pdf simulation (1-2 week) \
Collsion functions with static objects (3-4 week) \
Setting up objects collision scenes and collision functions for simple dynamic objects (5-6 week) \
Rendering and eventually bonus target (7-8 week)
